    "details": "**About the Starter** \n\n Hygraphlix is a movie streaming platform that demos Hygraph, NextJS 14, Tailwind CSS, and Mux. \n\n The Hygraphlix demo is a movie streaming platform that uses Hygraph to compose content from multiple sources.  \n\n **About the stack** \n\n The demo uses NextJS 14, Tailwind CSS, and Mux for video delivery. Movies are stored in Hygraph, but the metadata comes from an external system, in this case, a mock API called [Federate This](https://www.federatethis.com) that wraps the open-source movie database, OMDB. Hygraphlix shows how to create a Genre movie section with one query that combines native Hygraph content and OMDB metadata to sort movies by Genre. \n\n To get the most out of this demo, connect Mux: \n\n 1. [Sign up for a Mux account](https://dashboard.mux.com/signup) \n\n 2. [Install the Mux app in your Hygraph project](https://app.hygraph.com/apps/mux/new) \n\n 3. Create access tokens for your Mux account(https://hygraph.com/docs/integrations/connect-mux) \n\n Read more [here](https://hygraph.com/marketplace/starters/hygraph-nextjs-mux-movie-platform).",
